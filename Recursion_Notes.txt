-----------------Recursion-------------------
	Recursion : Recursion is defined when a funtion call itself by applying some subroutine on the  parameters by keeping an extra space overhead(Call Stack).

	
	1st-> Find the smallest subproblem for which we know the answer.
	2nd-> Assume that for the given problem recursion will correctly calculate a
		  subproblem.
	3rd-> Self Work.

		i)    Base Case.
		ii)   Recursive Assumption.
		iii)  Return result.
